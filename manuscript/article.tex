\begin{abstract}
Trending near real-time data is a complex task, specially in distributed
environments. This problem was typically tackled in financial and transaction
systems, but it now applies to its utmost in other contexts, such as hardware
monitoring in large-scale projects. Data handling requires subscription to
specific data feeds that need to be implemented avoiding replication, and rate of transmission has to be assured. On the side of the graphical client,
rendering needs to be fast enough so it may be perceived as real-time processing
and display.

ALMA Common Software (ACS) provides a software
infrastructure for distributed projects which may require trending large
volumes of data. For theses requirements ACS offers a Sampling System, which
allows sampling selected data feeds at different frequencies. Along with this,
it provides a graphical tool to plot the collected information, which needs
to perform as well as possible.

Currently there are many graphical libraries available for data trending. This
imposes a problem when trying to choose one: It is necessary to know which has
the best performance, and which combination of programming language and library
is the best decision.
This document analyzes the performance of different graphical libraries and
languages in order to present the optimal environment when writing or
re-factoring an application using trending technologies in distributed systems.
To properly address the complexity of the problem, a specific set of alternative
was pre-selected, including libraries in Java and Python, languages which are
part of ACS. A stress benchmark will be developed in a simulated distributed
environment using ACS in order to test the trending libraries.
